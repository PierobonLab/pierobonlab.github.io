#### Paolo Pierobon (PI)
![Image Description](/assets/images/Paolo Pierobon.jpg){: style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; 
border-radius: 50%; height: 100px;"}
Paolo is an Italian physicist that crossed the borders many years ago and travelled around Europe for his master and PhD. In his journey he moved from theoretical physics to immunology and on the way picked up passion for statistical physics, soft matter physics, microscopy, single molecule, microfluidics, cytoskeleton, cell polarity, cell motility, B cell, inflammation, data analysis etc etc. He spent 16 years in Institut Curie and 13 in the Immunity and Cancer unit in A.M.Lennon's Lab. Besides family, science, and traveling, he loves music (he plays acoustic guitar, e-guitar and bass guitar) and currently learns not to massacre music at the piano! Recently he has also picked up a passion for urban sketch (but you still have to wait a while to see some decent work)!

Luisa is a biomedical engineer who is trying to uncover the secret of lymphnode mechanics and the impact on the function of immune cells. She moved from Naples to Grenoble for her Master Thesis and then to Paris for her PhD.

#### Zoé Fusilier (PhD student)
Zoé is co-supervised by P.Pierobon and H.Moreau and works at [Institut Curie](https://institut-curie.org/) in the team of A.M.Lennon [Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of immune cells](https://institut-curie.org/team/lennon). She works on the topographical and mechanical properties of extracellular matrix in tumors.
