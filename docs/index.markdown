We are a team of cell biologists and biophysicists working on mechanical aspects of immune response, B cells (but not only), lymphocyte polarity, immune synapse and lymph node tissue properties. We love microscopy, image analysis, microfabrication and biophysical modeling. 

We are part of the [Immune cell signaling and retroviral infection team](https://institutcochin.fr/en/equipes/immune-cell-signaling-and-retroviral-infection) at [Institut Cochin](https://institutcochin.fr/en).

We are mounting a two-head team focused on cytoskeleton and immunity with [Jérôme Delon](https://institutcochin.fr/en/projets-recherche/role-rho-gtpases-immune-responses): stay tuned!
